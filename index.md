JBossWS-CXF 7.2.0.Final has been released. In this release, we introduced the throttling feature to better control the number of requests a backend service can handle within a specified
time frame. In addition to this new feature, we addressed several other issues, including a performance problem on the client side
[JBWS-4424](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JBWS-4424) and made a few enhancements.  For more detailed information and a full list of issues addressed in this release,
please check [release notes](https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310050&version=12425135). Please try this release out and give us your feedback!
