reviewed the usage in JBossWS projects and found we only use log4j dependencies in command line tools, client side
and testsuite. These are places we use log4j dependency:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/jbossws/jbossws-common-tools/blob/jbossws-common-tools-1.3.2.Final">jbossws-common-tools</a></p>

    <p>It is used to log debug and error messages when running the wsconsume or wsprovide command line tools.
Because these tools only run on the command line and do not run in the JavaEE/Jakarta EE container
server, this CVE issue doesn’t impact the jbossws projects, however
we reviewed the log4j usage in the command line tool and decided to remove this log4j 1.2.14 dependency in 
jbossws-common-tools 1.4.0.Final to 
directly log message to console or use jdk logger.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/jbossws/jbossws-cxf/tree/main/modules/testsuite">testsuite</a></p>

    <p>This is only for print some log message from our tests. These testsuite maven module won’t be included in 
runtime or used by other projects, so we are safe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/jbossws/jbossws-cxf/tree/main/modules/client">client</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jbossws/jbossws-cxf/tree/main/modules/jaspi">jaspi</a> modules</p>

    <p>The log4j is again used to print information for client side like what jbossws-common-tools does, and this CVE issue doesn’t impact 
the client stuff either. To make sure other project including either of this two dependencies doesn’t include the 
old version log4j we upgraded log4j version to 2.17.1 and released jbossws-cxf-5.5.0.Final. In the near future, we’ll
evaluate if it’s possible to remove log4j dependency to directly use jboss logger.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From above log4j usage in jbossws, if your project has dependency or transitive dependencies to any of these follow projects
please upgrade to jbossws-cxf-5.5.0.Final or jbossws-common-tools-1.4.0.Final. If you find any issue in this upgrade, please 
let us know.</p>]]></content><author><name>JBossWS Team</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[After log4j cve issues were reported, we carefully reviewed the usage in JBossWS projects and found we only use log4j dependencies in command line tools, client side and testsuite.

<p>During the first half of this year we've been working on fixing reported bugs of the JBossWS 5.1.x series. There are some plans for kicking off the 5.2 development, but at the moment the focus is still on maintaining the 5.1 series.</p>

<p>Anyway, JBossWS <a href="http://download.jboss.org/jbossws/ReleaseNotes-jbossws-cxf-5.1.3.Final.txt">5.1.3.Final</a>, <a href="http://download.jboss.org/jbossws/ReleaseNotes-jbossws-cxf-5.1.4.Final.txt">5.1.4.Final</a> and <a href="http://download.jboss.org/jbossws/ReleaseNotes-jbossws-cxf-5.1.5.Final.txt">5.1.5.Final</a> has been released and included in <a href="http://wildfly.org/">WildFly</a>… hey, did you notice that <strong><a href="http://wildfly.org/news/2016/08/19/WildFly10-1-Released/">WildFly 10.1.0.Final</a> is out</strong>? :-D Go and download it, it's really worth trying it!</p>

<p>As a consequence of 10.1.0.Final having been released, WildFly master has moved to 11 and here we are with a fresh WS piece of news…</p>

<p><strong>JBoss Wise is coming into WildFly!</strong> You can read more <a href="http://jbosswise.blogspot.com/2016/08/wise-gui-on-wildfly.html">here</a>, anyway what this basically means is that a GUI for testing WS endpoints is going to be available by default in WildFly soon.</p>

<p>Really nice, isn't it? :-)</p>]]></content><author><name>JBossWS Team</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summer is nearly over and last time I wrote here was just before last Christmas.. definitely time for an update!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Christmas 2015 releases!</title><link href="/2015/12/23/christmas-2015-releases/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Christmas 2015 releases!" /><published>2015-12-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2015-12-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/2015/12/23/christmas-2015-releases</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2015/12/23/christmas-2015-releases/"><![CDATA[<p>Just few hours before the holiday break and here we are with the last releases of the year!</p>

<p>First of all, <strong>WildFly 10.0.0.CR5</strong> has been released and will soon turn into <em>Final</em> assuming no major flaw is reported. You can read more on the release at <a href="http://wildfly.org/news/2015/12/23/WildFly10-CR5-Released/">wildfly.org</a>!</p>

<p>Speaking of web services, yesterday I've tagged the second micro release of JBossWS 5.1.x series and today you can download it from <a href="http://jbossws.jboss.org/downloads/latest">jbossws.jboss.org</a>. You might have noticed that we've released two bug fix versions this month: <strong>JBossWS 5.1.1.Final</strong> was mainly a 
bug fix
 release (but of course we also moved to the most recent <a href="http://cxf.apache.org/">Apache CXF</a> version), while <strong>JBossWS 5.1.2.Final</strong> is basically a 
performance
 improvement release, cut just in time to include it as a last minute change in WildFly 10 :-)</p>

<p>As usual, have a look at the <a href="http://download.jboss.org/jbossws/ReleaseNotes-jbossws-cxf-5.1.2.Final.txt">release notes</a> for a detailed list of changes. The supported target containers for both JBossWS releases are WildFly 9.0.0.Final, 9.0.1.Final and 9.0.2.Final.</p>

<p><em>The year is almost over, time to relax, give the last WildFly 10 CR a try and then get back fully recharged in 2016 to play with WildFly 10 Final :-)</em></p>
