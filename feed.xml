customization. By defining an XML, CLI, or Maven plugin, users can slim down the WildFly server and select the subsystems 
they want to install to run their application. For example, if a user’s application only requires JAX-RS, JPA, and 
Servlets and does not need EJB or JMS, the Galleon tool can help install a customized version of WildFly or EAP that 
only contains JAX-RS, JPA, Undertow, and other required dependent subsystems. Behind the WildFly Galleon technology, 
a feature pack provides the unit of WildFly that can be installed or uninstalled using Galleon tools. 
A feature pack is zipped and deployed to the Maven repository, and the Galleon tool can consume 
the feature pack as user-defined to install these units. 
In this post, we will discuss the new JBossWS CXF feature pack in the upcoming 6.3.0 release and how we can use this 
feature pack to install the new JBossWS CXF version to a WildFly server.</p>

<h4 id="jbossws-cxf-feature-pack">JBossWS CXF Feature Pack</h4>

<p>The JBossWS CXF feature pack contains all JBossWS packages to install in a WildFly server. All JBossWS related JBoss 
modules will be created or updated. With this JBossWS feature pack, the JBossWS version can be updated to 
the version in this feature pack. The JBossWS feature pack depends on the wildfly-ee-galleon-pack’s latest version. 
When the JBossWS-CXF feature pack is installed, the  wildfly-ee-galleon-pack will be installed before the
JBossWS CXF feature pack.</p>

<h4 id="install-jbossws-cxf-feature-pack-with-cli">Install JBossWS-CXF Feature Pack With CLI</h4>

<p>Galleon provides a CLI tool to install and customize the WildFly installation. Simply download the latest version of
<a href="https://github.com/wildfly/galleon/tree/5.1.0.Final">Galleon 5.1.0.Final</a>, unzip it, and the Galleon CLI tool is 
ready for use. Then, we can install the JBossWS CXF feature pack with this command:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>path/to/galleon-5.1.0.Final/bin/galleon.sh  install org.jboss.ws.cxf:jbossws-cxf-feature-pack:6.3.1-SNAPSHOT --dir=path/to/installation
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">galleon.sh install</code> can be run with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--layers</code> flag to define the subsystems you want to install. For more details,
please check <a href="https://docs.wildfly.org/27/Galleon_Guide.html">Galleon guide</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that Galleon requires Java 11 for runtime, and you should make sure that JDK11 or a higher version is set up properly.</p>

<h4 id="install-jbossws-cxf-feature-pack-with-maven">Install JBossWS CXF Feature Pack with Maven</h4>

<p>Another way to install the JBossWS-CXF feature pack is by using Maven. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">provision</code> goal in wildfly-maven-plugin installs the 
WildFly server in the Maven build. Here is an example to install the JBossWS CXF feature pack and provide only the features and packages 
included in the in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cloud-server</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">webservices</code> layers:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>        &lt;plugins&gt;
            &lt;plugin&gt;

                &lt;artifactId&gt;wildfly-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                &lt;version&gt;4.1.0.Beta5&lt;/version&gt;
                &lt;configuration&gt;

                    &lt;feature-packs&gt;
                        &lt;feature-pack&gt;

                        &lt;/feature-pack&gt;
                    &lt;/feature-packs&gt;
                    &lt;layers&gt;
                        &lt;layer&gt;cloud-server&lt;/layer&gt;
                        &lt;layer&gt;webservices&lt;/layer&gt;
                    &lt;/layers&gt;
                &lt;/configuration&gt;
                &lt;executions&gt;
                    &lt;execution&gt;
                        &lt;goals&gt;
                            &lt;goal&gt;provision&lt;/goal&gt;
                        &lt;/goals&gt;
                    &lt;/execution&gt;
                &lt;/executions&gt;
            &lt;/plugin&gt;
        &lt;/plugins&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wildfly-maven-plugin</code>’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">provision</code> goal offers a lot of flexibility to Maven projects for 
testing with the WFLY server and updating specific units within it. In the JBossWS project, this plugin 
is currently being utilized to build a customized version of the WildFly server. This new server is 
then used to execute all tests with the latest JBossWS CXF version installed, ensuring a reliable 
and up-to-date testing environment.</p>

<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

<p>Galleon is a good tool for reducing the size of the WildFly server distribution. When install with the 
jbossws-cxf-feature pack, it simplifies the process of replacing and updating the JBossWS unit in WildFly. 
If you’re looking to remove specific subsystems or units from your WildFly distribution and install a new 
version of the WildFly unit, it’s best to avoid doing it manually. Instead, make use of Galleon or the 
wildfly-maven-plugin to ensure an efficient process.</p>]]></content><author><name>Jim Ma</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The WildFly Galleon project is designed to allow users to install, uninstall, and patch products with a high degree of customization.

project and add new things in the upcoming JBossWS 6.3.0 release. In this blog post,
we will discuss this topic and give an update what will be included in the new release.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>JBossWS Galleon Feature Pack</p>

    <p><a href="https://docs.wildfly.org/galleon">WildFly Galleon</a> allows users to create custom distributions of 
the WildFly application server. It uses feature pack to specify a set of components to include in 
the custom Wildfly server. 
In JBossWS 6.3.0, the new jbossws-cxf-feature-pack will be provided. User can install this feature
pack in any of released WildFly 27 and WildFly 28 or 28-SNAPSHOT version. This feature pack will be
included in JBossWS dist module and create the custom WildFly server to run whole test suite.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cloud Support</p>

    <p>Containerized java application can be the first step to easily deploy to the cloud and scale up 
or down based on demand. In the next JBossWS release, we’ll improve JBossWS cloud support and create 
examples/docs about how to run a webservice endpoint in docker container. 
The Openshift platform provides numerous benefits for running applications like scalability,high 
availability,resource efficiency, rollout and rollback. To allow user to easily deploy webservice 
application to the Openshift, we’ll provide better support and guidance to run webservice on OpenShift.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clean build</p>

    <p>In the previous JBossWS releases, we have to use many arguments and maven profiles to run all jbossws
tests and build all artifacts. This will be cleaned and improved in the upcoming 6.3.0 release. We’ll 
deprecate the old maven profiles and make JBossWS buildable with the simple maven build command line
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mvn clean install</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More Jakarta EE support</p>

    <p>From JBossWS 6.x, we already changed the javax package name to jakarta and imported the new jakarta 
dependencies. For the third party dependencies, we’ll update as many jakarta dependency as we can, 
with particular focus on CXF 4.0.1.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This is a preliminary version for our project roadmap. It is subject to change as we continue to look at what else 
we can bring in the next release. We welcome your comments and would appreciate any feedback you have. Please leave us

reviewed the usage in JBossWS projects and found we only use log4j dependencies in command line tools, client side
and testsuite. These are places we use log4j dependency:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/jbossws/jbossws-common-tools/blob/jbossws-common-tools-1.3.2.Final">jbossws-common-tools</a></p>

    <p>It is used to log debug and error messages when running the wsconsume or wsprovide command line tools.
Because these tools only run on the command line and do not run in the JavaEE/Jakarta EE container
server, this CVE issue doesn’t impact the jbossws projects, however
we reviewed the log4j usage in the command line tool and decided to remove this log4j 1.2.14 dependency in 
jbossws-common-tools 1.4.0.Final to 
directly log message to console or use jdk logger.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/jbossws/jbossws-cxf/tree/main/modules/testsuite">testsuite</a></p>

    <p>This is only for print some log message from our tests. These testsuite maven module won’t be included in 
runtime or used by other projects, so we are safe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/jbossws/jbossws-cxf/tree/main/modules/client">client</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jbossws/jbossws-cxf/tree/main/modules/jaspi">jaspi</a> modules</p>

    <p>The log4j is again used to print information for client side like what jbossws-common-tools does, and this CVE issue doesn’t impact 
the client stuff either. To make sure other project including either of this two dependencies doesn’t include the 
old version log4j we upgraded log4j version to 2.17.1 and released jbossws-cxf-5.5.0.Final. In the near future, we’ll
evaluate if it’s possible to remove log4j dependency to directly use jboss logger.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From above log4j usage in jbossws, if your project has dependency or transitive dependencies to any of these follow projects
please upgrade to jbossws-cxf-5.5.0.Final or jbossws-common-tools-1.4.0.Final. If you find any issue in this upgrade, please 
let us know.</p>]]></content><author><name>Jim Ma</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[After log4j cve issues were reported, we carefully reviewed the usage in JBossWS projects and found we only use log4j dependencies in command line tools, client side and testsuite.
