We are pleased to announce the release of JBossWS-CXF 7.3.0.Final. In this release,
weâ€™ve upgraded CXF to version 4.0.5, woodstox-core from 6.4.0 to 7.0.0 and addressed several important issues, including
[JBWS-4430](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JBWS-4430). For more details,
please see the [Release Notes](https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310050&version=12431262).

If you are currently using JBossWS 7.2.0.Final, we recommend upgrading to this version,
especially if you are using CDI in the SOAP handler or CXF interceptors.

Please try out this release, and let us know if you have any issues or questions.
