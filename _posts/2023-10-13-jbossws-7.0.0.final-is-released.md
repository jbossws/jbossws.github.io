We are pleased to announce the release of JBossWS-CXF 7.0.0.Final. In this release, we created cloud test 
utils to help create JBossWS test on Kubernetes and added the tests and docker image to demonstrate how 
to create web service with JBossWS/WFLY on Kubernetes environment.
And another important change is we removed xerces dependency in JBossWS and now all uses the JAXP implementation
from JDK itself. In this release, we fixed an important security issue [JBWS-4389](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JBWS-4389) in WS-Security UsernameToken authentication
, special thanks to Diana Krepinska for the hard work on this issue,  and last but not least, all binaries will be built with JDK11 and plus from JBossWS 7.0.0.Final.
We already changed the CI build and release configuration to compile all things with JDK11 and JDK17 now.
For more detailed info and full list of issue in this release, please check [release notes](https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310050&version=12409746).
Please try this release out and give us your feedback!
