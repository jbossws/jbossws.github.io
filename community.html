<h3>Community discussions</h3>

<p>You can get in touch with other JBossWS users on the project's
    <a href="https://github.com/jbossws/jbossws-cxf/discussions">Github discussion</a> or <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/jbossws ">Google group</a>
</p>

<h3>How to get involved</h3>

<p><span class="postbody">Despite having an established source code base, the JBossWS project has several areas of development that are suitable for external contributers to get involved with. </span>
</p>
<p><span class="postbody">The way we usually work is that people who want to join the team make themselves visible on the forums by providing qualified comments. There is also a large number of Jira issues that need attention (besides being marked for community contribution or not). This is also a good way to get familiar with the code base. Finally there are also pieces of missing functionality that need to be taken care off, which is of course the most attractive option.</span>
</p>
<p><span class="postbody">If you are want to start with something specific or propose areas of development / ideas, feel free to write to the <a
        href="mailto:alessio.soldano@jboss.com">project lead</a>.<br/> <br/> </span><span
        class="postbody">Then to actually contribute you'll need to </span>read the terms for the
    Contributor Agreement and sign it:
    <a href="https://jboss.org/contribute">https://jboss.org/contribute</a></p>
<p>Good luck ;-)</p>
